## Following instructions have been given for the assignment -

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## Your Shiny Application

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

1. 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
2. Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
3. A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box


# My Shiny Application - [The U.S. States Analysis App](https://aniruddhachakraborty.shinyapps.io/us_states_analysis/)

This Shiny Application developed as a part of Developing Data Products Course Project, on The **U.S. States Analysis** has the following main features ->  

* **Interactive States Selection,** which allows users to select a group of U.S. states from the U.S. map interactively with the help of a Shiny attribute - **Brush**. The Analysis then filters as per the selected states.
* **3 in 1 Datasets Analysis** allows users to further select a dataset out of 3 available datasets and perform Exploaratory Data Analysis in the areas of Education and Related Statistics, Public-School Expenditures and Violent Crime Rates by US States.  
* **Cascade Input Filter Selection** - Based on the dataset selected, it allows user to further select a **Fill variable** in order to fill and analyze the U.S. states by that variable.
